in this test, user starts at root page for services, 
logs into the service, goes to their appointments page,
views their appointments as a provider, and logs out

Baseline - single instance:
	We notice that successful responses are served at a constant rate, 
    despite varying number of requests: shown from graph
        stored in final.zip and comp.zip

	Upon inspection of nginx logs on the EB instance, we see that 
    there is some file descriptor issue with the Rails app UNIX socket which
    causes the 502 errors
    Specifically, it looks like the errors start from arrival phase 6

	```
	2021/11/29 06:21:42 [error] 8338#8338: *186014 connect() to unix:///var/run/puma/my_app.sock 
    failed (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) while connecting to upstream, client: 54.184.171.126, 
    serve3r: _, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://unix:///var/run/puma/my_app.sock:/", 
    host: "koki.eba-8zhfquyf.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com"
	```

	This leads us to vertically scale

Vertically Scaled 1:

	The 502 issues are now gone from the vertical scaling as shown in the graphs

    Thus, now will push limits by increasing the arrival phases from 7 -> 10
    Leads to more 502 errors
        2021/11/29 22:13:34 [error] 11413#11413: *2019088 connect() to unix:///var/run/p

        t-2.elasticbeanstalk.com"

Vertically Scaled 2:
    502 errors still presist thus will horizontally scale to 10 with vert scale 1
            2021/11/29 22:13:34 [error] 11413#11413: *2019088 connect() to unix:///var/run/p

Horizontally Scaled + vertical 1:
    500 errors started to occur, but there is a decrease in the 502 errors

    will now scale vertically as well 

Horizontally Scaled + vertical 2:
    no errors
